       <h2>Pacific Trails Origin</h2>
       <p>
       Pacific Trails Resort was founded back in 1987 originally as small female-only campsite by married couple Nicole and Rosemary Rivermoore. Over the years, the campsite grew with interest by the local LGBTQ+ community in the Bay area which led to the decision to make the site co-ed around the Fall of 1994. In 2003, Nicole and Rosemary decided to expand the campsite into a resort and started construction. By spring 2007, construction was completed in time for the 20th anniversy of Pacific Trails,officaly dropping "Campsite" to "Resort" and becoming the place we now currently know. Pacific Trails Resort is proud to say we are a woman owned business with advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community.
